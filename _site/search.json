      "title": "Condition Assessment Method",
      "author": [],
      "contents": "\nIntroduction\nThis document sets out a proposed method for carrying out condition assessments in England to support biodiversity net gain (BNG) assessments. The aim is to standardise the approach to carrying out condition assessments to aid repeatability and replicability. This will ensure that ecologists and regulators can be confident that condition assessments have been carried out to a consistent and appropriate standard.\nIt will also facilitate data sharing and scrutiny by providing a standard set of variables to record in the field and a standard way to store and share these data.\nThe philosophy here is: collect data first, assess condition second.\nThere is danger in trying to decide whether a criterion is passed or failed in real time in the absence of objective data (quantified where possible). It is better to collect data on which to base an assessment. Where possible, this could be automated based on the data, but it may require a more nuanced judgement based on experience.\nContributing to this method document\nThis is very much a work in progress!\nDigital Ecology has made this an open document – we hope that developing a method for habitat condition assessment will be a collaborative project. We invite people to contribute their ideas and help improve and shape this document.\nDigital Ecology has made this document available on Codeberg under a CC-BY-SA 4.0 licence. You are welcome to download it and edit it and then upload that edited version to Codeberg. You will need to make a request to merge your changes with the main document via a pull request. Digital Ecology will then review this and merge the changes you have proposed where appropriate. To discuss the contents of the document you can raise an issue on Codeberg. Issues could be proposed changes, errors, omissions or other points worthy of discussion before making changes to the text.\nYou can also make comments and suggestions via email (habitatcondition@digital-ecology.co.uk) or on LinkedIn, where this document was first announced.\nCondition assessments\nThere are a total of 25 different habitats for which there are condition assessments, listed below. For many there are proposals for how to carry out data collection to undertake a condition assessment. For many others, there are questions posed about how the criterion is practicably measured. Most of the coastal and freshwater habitats are left blank as this is not my area of expertise!\n1. Coastal\n2. Coastal lagoons\n3. Coastal saltmarsh\n4. Ditch\n5. Grassland – Low distinctiveness\n6. Grassland Medium – Very High distinctiveness\n7. Heathland\n8. Hedgerow\n9. Intertidal biogenic reefs\n10. Intertidal hard structures\n11. Intertidal seagrass\n12. Intertidal sediment\n13. Lake\n14. Limestone Pavement\n15. Line of Trees\n16. Orchard\n17. Pond\n18. Rocky Shore\n19. Scrub\n20. Sparsely Vegetated Land\n21. Urban\n22. Urban trees\n23. Wetland\n24. Woodland\n25. Wood-pasture and Parkland\nProposed methods, where applicable, are set out below.\n1 – Coastal\n2 – Coastal lagoons\n3 – Coastal saltmarsh\n4 – Ditch\n\nCriterion\nMethod\n1\nThe ditch is of good water quality, with clear water (low turbidity) indicating no obvious signs of pollution.\nMeasure using a Secchi disk. How to define good vs poor in this?\n2\nA range of emergent, submerged and floating leaved plants are present. As a guide >10 species of emergent, floating or submerged plants in a 20 m ditch length.\nSurvey minimum 4x 5m sections. Pass if average >10 species per 20 m, fail if not.\n3\nThere is less than 10% cover of filamentous algae and/or duckweed (these are signs of eutrophication).\nSurvey minimum 4x 5m sections and estimate cover.\n4\nA fringe of marginal vegetation is present along more than 75% of the ditch.\nMeasure in minimum 4x 5m sections.\n5\nPhysical damage evident along less than 5% of the ditch, such as excessive poaching, damage from machinery use or storage, or any other damaging management activities.\nMeasure in minimum 4x 5m sections.\n6\nSufficient water levels are maintained; as a guide a minimum summer depth of approximately 50 cm in minor ditches and 1 m in main drains.\nMeasure water levels in summer with a ruler!\n7\nLess than 10% of the ditch is heavily shaded.\nDefine ‘heavily’. Measure in minimum 4x 5m sections.\n8\nThere is an absence of non-native plant and animal species.\nRecord plants in minimum 4x 5m sections. How are INNS animals detected?\nSummary: Minimum of 4x 5m sections to collect data for 2,3,4,5,7, 8 Additional work needed for animals in criterion 8. How are they detected? eDNA – considerable cost for a potentially large no of ditches. 6 means summer survey, or precautionary approach is to record a fail.\nAnalysis of Ethos Environmental Planning Ltd ditch data from 2022 (n = 64) shows average ditch length = 206 m, shortest = 12m, longest = 913m. Only one ditch less than 20m.\n5 – Grassland (Low distinctiveness)\n\nCriterion\nMethod\n1\nThere must be 6-8 species per m 2 . If a grassland has 9 or more species per m 2 it should be classified as a medium distinctiveness grassland habitat type.

Most important that this is recorded in late summer / early autumn which is the driest time of year.\n\nFor Green roofs only.\n\n4c1\nIntensive green roofs – have a minimum of 50% native and non-native wildflowers - 70% of the roof area is soil and vegetation (including water features).\nMinimum of 3x 2m x 2m quadrats, record species and % cover of plants and bare ground.\n4c2\nBiodiverse green roofs - have a varied depth of 80 - 150mm at least 50% is at 150mm and is planted and seeded with wildflowers and sedums or is pre-prepared with sedums and wildflowers. To achieve Good condition some additional habitat, such as sand piles, logs etc. should be present.\n10 x measurements of substrate depth. Minimum of 3x 2m x 2m quadrats, record species and % cover record presence of additional habitats (sand piles, logs etc.)\n22 – Urban trees\n\nCriterion\nMethod\n1\nThe tree is a native species (or more than 70% within the block are native species).\nRecord species of tree(s).\n2\nThe tree canopy is predominantly continuous, with gaps in canopy cover making up <10% of total area and no individual gap being >5 m wide (individual trees automatically pass this criterion).\nRecord the length/width of any gaps in canopy.\n3\nThe tree is mature or veteran (or more than 50% within the block are mature or veteran).\nRecord girth and veteran features for each tree.\n4\nThere is little or no evidence of an adverse impact on tree health by anthropogenic activities such as vandalism or herbicide use. There is no current regular pruning regime, so the trees retain >75% of expected canopy for their age range and height.\nRecord evidence of anthropogenic activities. Record any pruning.\n5\nMicro-habitats for birds, mammals and insects are present e.g. presence of deadwood, cavities, ivy or loose bark.\nRecord presence of microhabitats.\n6\nMore than 20% of the tree canopy area is oversailing vegetation beneath.\nMap location of habitat beneath trees to estimate area of canopy over vegetation (GIS).\n23 – Wetland\n\nCriterion\nMethod\n1\nThe water table is at or near the surface throughout the year, this could be open water or saturation of soil at the surface. There is no artificial drainage, unless specifically to maintain water levels as specified above. NB - this criterion is essential for achieving good condition.\nHow do you do this? Need to measure this in summer at the driest time of year.\n2\nThe appearance and composition of the vegetation closely matches characteristics of the specific wetland habitat type (see UKHab definition linked above). Indicator species for the specific wetland habitat type are very clearly and easily visible.\nMinimum of 3x 2m x 2m quadrats, record species % cover .\n3\nThe water supplies (groundwater, surface water and/or rainwater) to the wetland are of good water quality, with clear water (low turbidity) indicating no obvious signs of pollution.\nHow to do this?\n4\nCover of scrub and scattered trees less than 10%.\n10m x 10m quadrats? Grid site and record presence/absence in each? Estimate?\n5\nCover of bare ground less than 5%.\nMinimum of 3x 2m x 2m quadrats, record % cover of bare ground.\n6\nThere is an absence of invasive non-native species (as listed on Schedule 9 of WCA, 1981) and species indicative of sub-optimal condition 1 make up less than 5% of ground cover.\nMinimum of 3x 2m x 2m quadrats, record species % cover.\n\nFor Fen and Purple moor grass and rush pasture only\n\n7a\nNo more than 25% of the fen area has a continuous cover of litter (i.e. dead vegetation) preventing regeneration.\nMinimum of 3x 2m x 2m quadrats, record % cover of litter.\n\nFor Bog habitat only.\n\n7b\nSphagnum and cottongrasses are at least frequent. Cover of ericaceous dwarf-shrubs 2 is less than 75%.\nMinimum of 3x 2m x 2m quadrats, record % cover of plants.\n\nFor Reedbed habitat only\n\n7c\nThe reedbed has a diverse structure with between 60 and 80% reeds. Other areas may include open water (at least 10%), species-rich fen and/or wet woodland.\n10m x 10m quadrats? Grid site and record presence/absence in each? Estimate?\n\nFor Floodplain wetland mosaic (CFGM) only.\n\n7d\nAll ditches recorded within the habitat achieve Good condition as assessed using the Ditch condition sheet.\nSee Ditch condition above.\n24 – Woodland\n25 – Wood-pasture & Parkland\n\nCriterion\nMethod\n1\nPresence of ancient and / or veteran trees.\nRecord girth and veteran features for each qualifying tree.\n2\nTrees are of a range of different ages to ensure replacement. Three age classes are present and must include at least one of the following: mature, late-mature, ancient or veteran trees.\nRecord age classes of all trees.\n3\nPresence of standing and / or fallen deadwood: Wood-pasture - All ancient and veteran trees have standing deadwood, large dead branches, stems and stumps associated with them. Parkland - 80% of ancient and veteran trees have standing deadwood, large dead branches, stems and stumps associated with them.\nRecord standing in all eligible trees and fallen deadwood.\n4\nThere is little or no evidence of an adverse impact on tree health by anthropogenic activities, livestock or wild animals, or pests or diseases (e.g. no evidence of poaching, nettles, ground compaction, bare ground under trees or grazing damage to bark and roots).\nRecord presence of any adverse impact on trees.\n5\nGround cover comprises semi-natural grassland or heathland.\nMap ground cover vegetation.\n6\nGrassland or heathland habitat is subject to an appropriate management regime: Grassland - Sward height is varied (at least 20% of the sward is less than 7 cm and at least 20 per cent is more than 7 cm) creating microclimates which provide opportunities for insects, birds and small mammals to live and breed. Heathland - There is a range of age classes of heather present, with the following proportions: pioneer heather 10-40%, building/mature heather 20-80%, degenerate heather <30% and dead heather <10%.\nSee grassland and heathland methods.\n\n\n\n",
