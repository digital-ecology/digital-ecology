I am a Digital Ecologist working at the interface of ecology and digital technology. I am interested in how digital tech can be harnessed to help deliver better biodiversity outcomes.

I am also interested in biodiversity net gain methods and practice. I deliver training on BNG and help organisations develop methods and processes to deliver better outcomes for nature.

I talk about BNG, QGIS, R, open source and data. I work on tools and systems that help people maximise the value of their data. Contact me to talk about any of that.
